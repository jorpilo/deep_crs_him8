requirements:
numpy, scikit

Dataset:

codes:
PCA folder contains our code to implement PCA on our datasets to obtain top 100 principle compoenents and then calculate mean squared error, euclidean distance and cosine error to see the similarity between the bands.

Denoising folder contains the denoise methods we use in this project.

OpticalFlow folder has opticalflow.py contains how we implement optical flow on each pixel and display our result. 

FramePrediction 

Clustering implements two types of clustering: KMeans and MeanShift on input dataset

Rain Prediction
